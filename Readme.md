## My Progress

### 1. Draw Grid and Filled Cube
In this step, I learned the basics of how to draw pixel to the screen by using SDL2 library. I understand what the pixel/color buffer is.

### 2. Point Cloud Cube with Orthographic Projection
In this step, I learned what the orthographic projection is and how to draw a 3D point cloud cube. With an extra effort I implemented basic transform animation :)

### 3. Point Cloud Cube with Perspective Projection
In this step, I learned what the perspective projection is and implemented it to the previously created point cloud cube.

### 4. Rotating Points in 3D Space
In this step, I learned how to rotate a point by using the basic trigonometry formulas. Then I rotate the entire mesh with an animation.

### 5. Triangulated Wireframe Box
In this step, I learned how to draw a line between two points. Then, I refactored my box mesh code to re-structure it as a triangulated mesh. After that, I rendered the triangulated mesh by using the new draw line method that I learned.

## About the Course

I study 3D Computer Graphics Programming with this wonderful course: https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming

Gustavo Pezzi teaches 3D graphics programming from scratch without using any 3d graphics library like OpenGL or DirectX. It is truly eye-opening and I recommend it whoever curious about how the computer graphics actually made.
